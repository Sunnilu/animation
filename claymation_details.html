    <h2>Detailed Claymation Manipulation</h2>
    <p>Animators can manipulate individual parts of the clay figure, like facial expressions, limbs, or clothing, to create complex actions.</p>
    <p>Careful lighting is crucial to ensure consistent appearance across frames, and backgrounds may be created separately or incorporated into the clay scene.</p>
    <h3>Key Points About Claymation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time-Intensive:</strong> Due to the need to reposition the clay for each frame, creating claymation animation is very time-consuming.</li>
      <li><strong>Plasticine is Key:</strong> Most claymation uses plasticine because of its ability to hold its shape and not dry out quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Famous Examples:</strong> Some well-known claymation characters include Gumby, Wallace and Gromit, and the California Raisins.</li>
